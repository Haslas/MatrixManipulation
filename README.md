# MatrixManipulation
Python Programs for the manipulation of matrices.

Created while off of sick due to a fever and watching The Office (US).  Took longer than I would like to admit. (2-3 ish hours.)
The plan is to use these functions with other processes (eg Neural Network, etc.) which should have the correct inputs, hense the lack of a good input method, or much error-handling.
The "\*args" might need to be changed to just accepting an array.  This was a slightly easier method when testing the functions.
